# Beat Pads - iOS Version

## Important Disclaimer

This App is **ONLY** usable as a Midi Controller. It does **NOT** produce any sound on its own as of yet, but requires a host application or second device with Ableton, Fruity Loops, Garage Band, Logic, a Software Synthesizers or any other Music Production Software.

Can be used with any Mac via USB or WiFi. Usage with PC is limited to WiFi with free third-party software (rtpMidi), and USB with third-party USB midi connectors, due to Apple's limited implementation of USB Midi on iOS.

If you don't know what any of that that means, then this app is probably not useful to you.

Otherwise, continue reading and I hope you will have a lot of fun with it!
