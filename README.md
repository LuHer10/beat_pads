# Beat Pads

## ! Important !

This App is **ONLY** usable as a USB Midi Controller. It does **NOT** produce any sound on its own, but requires a device with Ableton, Fruity Loops, Garage Band, Logic, Software Synthesizers or any other Music Production Software. It also requires your phone to support the Midi Protocol over USB. This should apply to most Android phones running Marshmellow or newer (Android v6) and all iPhones. If you don't know what any of that that means, then this app is probably not useful for you. Otherwise, I hope you enjoy it a lot!
