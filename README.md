## Information

Beat Pads is a lightweight Midi Controller app for mobile phones and tablets for melodies and finger drumming at home and on the go. Connections can be made virtually to other apps via platform midi channels or via USB to other devices.

Beat Pads is not trying to be complete DAW controller and Midi swiss army knife. Its aim is to be an easy to use pad input device featuring a variety of layouts, intuitive playability and modern modulation options, such as MPE and Polyphonic Aftertouch. It was designed for people that prefer pads to pianos!

This App is **ONLY** usable as a Midi Controller. It does **NOT** produce any sound on its own as of yet, but requires a host application or a second device with a DAW or other sound production app.

AUv3 is unfortunately not supported at this time, as it is [currently impossible with Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/16092).

Wifi works on iOS, but Wifi and Bluetooth support is otherwise limited due to platform restrictions.
