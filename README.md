# Beat Pads

## ! Important Disclaimer !

This App is **ONLY** usable as a Midi Controller. It does **NOT** produce any sound on its own, but requires a host application or second device with Ableton, Fruity Loops, Garage Band, Logic, a Software Synthesizers or any other Music Production Software. It also requires your phone or tablet to support Midi over USB. This should apply to most Android phones running Marshmellow or newer (from Android 6 Marshmellow), all iPhones and iPads. If you don't know what any of that that means, then this app is probably not useful to you. 

Otherwise, continue reading and I hope you will have a lot of fun with it!
